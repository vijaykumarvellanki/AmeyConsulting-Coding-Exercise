# AmeyConsulting-Coding-Exercise
Implemented logic for Five most commonly occuring number (task 1 and 2).
Implemented in ASP.Net Core MVC.
If you run the application it expert a file to be uploaded.
Checked in the sample file under Files folder as well to the application. We should use this file only and we can modify the file.
When we select that file and click on upload it shows the result of five most commonly occuring numbers in descending order of frequency under Uploadbutton.
Regarding Task 3, I added one file LargeNumberDBRecords.cs to the solution.
I am using BulkCopy with Batching and batch size mentioned as 1000.
